## What's on!

At the Demo pod we ran a live streamed modelling to VR pipeline to show people how quickly they can have a VR experience up and running  :bulb:. We had

-  Jim Cook@unit92
-  Chris Hammang@cjhammang
-  Lydia@lydia-gu

as Chris and Jim Cook will be working on the content for BIO1997 together :+1: and it’s a great Segway into the pedagogy sessions. 

Woe to Go is the concept we are looking at, how to go from nothing to an immersive VR experience in under 30 minutes.

We are happy to host a QnA, And talk to the process of Capstone projects in the school of IT and how you can get High fidelity experiences for little to no budget to support your Proof of Concepts.
